# XOR Problem using Backpropagation in Neural Network

## Description
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates solving the XOR problem using a neural network trained with backpropagation. The XOR problem is a classic problem in machine learning and neural networks, where the goal is to model a binary XOR gate using the network.

## Installation
The notebook can be run using Jupyter Notebook. Ensure you have Jupyter installed; if not, you can install it using pip:
```sh
pip install notebook
